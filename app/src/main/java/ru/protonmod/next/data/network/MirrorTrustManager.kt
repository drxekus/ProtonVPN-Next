/**
 * Trusts what Android trusts, plus Proton's alternative-routing endpoints.
 *
 * Proton's alternative routing reaches the API through hosts whose certificates are not issued by
 * a public CA; the official client accepts them only when the leaf certificate's key is one of
 * Proton's published pins. This class used to accept *every* chain the system rejected and rely on
 * pinning "afterwards" — but most hosts are not pinned at all, so any certificate, including an
 * attacker's self-signed one, was accepted for them. Now an untrusted chain is refused unless its
 * leaf key is pinned. The leaf is the only certificate whose private key the TLS handshake proves.
